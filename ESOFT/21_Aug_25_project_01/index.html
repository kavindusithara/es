  <h2 class="html">WHAT IS HTML</h2>

  <p class="p">Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you
    are writing.

    HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.

    The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For
    now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

  <h2 class="h"> The History of HTML</h2>

  <p class="p">
    HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text
    Markup Language.

    Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to
    another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

    A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do
    this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h">What are Tags and Attributes?</h2>

  <p class="p smallcaps">Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

    They work together but perform different functions â€“ it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
